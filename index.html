Also it’s the main concept that I work with
    in order to regulate habits.

This is the brain that governs emotional impulses (most relevant here; passion, love, fear and anxiety), memory and decision-making,
    while also being the link between the two other brains.</p><p>So when you started reading this the cerebral cortex was probably in charge, as this was a conscious decision to gain knowledge for whatever intrinsic motivating reason you are here to learn because of, or so I hope at least, it could also be that this
    post conveniently popped up as the limbic system had taken over, looking for “constructive procrastination opportunities” and here you are (which is my own reason for reading and watching a lot of weird stuff, making me somewhat of a brainiac on all
    matters not suited for pop-quizzes) In either way, you should rejoice as I bring clarity with included solutions. (disclaimer: solutions requires work, get your magical quick fixes at the quack doctors office)</p><p>As I push you with these three simple reflections, I’m almost sure to trigger some sort of subconscious pain, which makes the limbic system take over, without you knowing it, the limbic system takes over in order to find a brief and effective relief of
    the mental stress created.
</p><p>Knowing this; understadning mental friction is easy, it’s basically the amount of mental energy you have to use in order to do a certain task. Some rules of thumb for this is:</p><ul>
    <li>If there’s little no non mental energy requires, the limbic system will see no reason to take over and you can easily hit the ground running.</li>
</ul><p>Knowing something and wanting to act on it, is a result of the cerebral cortex, which works mainly on a conscious level. Actual behavior, the “acting upon part”, is controlled by the limbic system, which is way stronger than the cerebral cortex, as it
    controls decision making, and as the limbic system mainly works on a subconscious level, willpower is rarely enough to make a chance.</p><p>This is why most doctors are slightly overweight, though they know better than anyone why to exercise and eat healthy and all that. Why those researching sleep and knows the depths of it’s importance, rarely get enough, as they work by observing other
    people sleep, not by doing it themselves.</p><p>Which concludes the point I started this post about being an extremely reliable predicting factor for when we act irrational, like the above examples.</p><p>A psychotherapist or a coach, will try and help you adapt to the environment, effectively helping you to either sail or fly. In most cases this is will a dramatic chance, redesigning you to become either a boat or an airplane. A few are succesful in a
    sort of hybrid, James Bond like solution, though for most this is wishful thinking. And if you enjoy being a car and don’t want to be made into a boat or an airplane, that does not sound like an optimal solution to me.</p><p>I would much rather look at you and say “Ok. So you are a car, this is how a car works and this is it’s potential and it’s limitations”, then design a way for a car to cross from one country to another.
</p><p>It might be a bridge, so an unlimited amount of other cars can enjoy the same solution, it can be car transport on a boat or even by airplane. Effectively designing the environment to adapt to the car and not the other way around, making it more enjoyable
    to be a car.</p><p>Now shift out the word car with human being and the challenge of going from one country to another, with a variety of other challenges, like handling finances, living healthy, being productive, being happy and you get the picture of what I do.</p><p>Bonus info: The way I wrote this entire post, reading to the process above: I’m taking a holiday, which means there’s no pressure or stress for me to perform and write whatsoever. (no fear of not performing, triggering the limbic system to make me procrastinate,
    letting me write in a state of mind controlled by the cerebral cortex, allowing for creative and constructive writing) Then something triggered me to start thinking about this concept, to which I decided to write something in order to share my knowledge
    on this favorite subject of mine. I did not decide to write the entire post right there, but I ended up doing it anyways. I just started off like “in order to remember to write about it, let me just get started with some basic definitions and tag
    as few things to remember writing about, it’ll only take like 5 min.” So I started writing, and as I was already started, I could just as well, give an example or two of this or that, like having a great casual conversation with a friends or intersting
    new person. Suddenly I’ve emptied out my mind on paper for everyone to enjoy. (if you didn’t; that’s ok)</p><p>This mindset of “in intersting conversation” is a narrative I followed and now conclude and continue with: “Well now I’ve been talking for a while; do you have any questions, anything to add or?”</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="25"><!-- react-empty: 26 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="27"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="29"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="30"><span data-reactid="31"><!-- react-empty: 32 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="33"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="34">Gamification Consultant</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="37"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
