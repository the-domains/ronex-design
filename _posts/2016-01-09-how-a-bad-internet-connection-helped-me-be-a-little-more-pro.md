# How a bad internet connection helped me be a little more productive

As a Gamification enthusiast and and pathological optimist, meeting this screen:
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6f02409d9ce27094bcb36fe306aee6a42579112e.png)

Is an opportunity to be a little more productive.

This is League of Legend's so called "LeaverBuster", in short it's an automated system to punish people who often go AFK (away from keyboard) and leave during games, as leaving people one man short in a game where teamplay is crucial, almost always results in the team being one man short, is loosing that game.

No wonder this behavior is discouraged as it creates a bad experience for all involved.

As you can see above, the way they punish people to incentive them to stick thing out, is to make people wait a certain amount of time before being able to simple join the queue to find a match, and then you have to wait 5 times.
They start at 5 min. punishment, but as you can see, my internet problems have extended beyond that.â€¨I don't know if there's a larger time amount before blocking an account entirely.

The reason I'm faced with this screen is not because I'm a "rage-quitting douchebag kid", but simply because I've been having a bad internet connection where I get a few minutes "timeouts" on my connection now and then, meaning what I don't have internet connection for a few minutes and therefor cannot participate in the fight, and even though I join a few minutes later, the other team have much likely exploited this and have gotten an unfair advantage.

I find myself somewhat wrongfully punished but "hey! Lets be constructive on this :D

20 min.? That's basically a Pomodoro!".

So when I've done some good work and want to reward myself with a game of LoL, I sometimes have to wait these 20 min. to where I would normally take a game right away, I now spend the 20 min. waiting time to get some work done.
Usually I do a series of quick tasks, like the dishes, laundry or some very monotone tasks, like scanning in my stacks of business cards to Evernote. In this case; I'm writing this entire post (so sorry in advance for the not-so-perfect grammar It will undoubtfully have)

If you are unfamiliar with the Pomodoro technique, perhaps you should do yourself a major favor and learn about it, as it's a personal favorite of mine (thank you Barbara Oaekly!)

This case has another scarcity component to it than other Pomodoroes, that I find rather intriguing, as I can feel on myself, that I work even harder and more focused while having this extra pressure up, because basically, if I'm not back before a match is found and click "join group", it throws me out of the matchmaking queue and I have to wait another 20 min., without the number of times I receive this punishment drops.

The good thing is that I work faster usually, the bad thing is two things:

* I'm done with something in 18 min. and can't make whatever's next in 2, so I don't start and only do an 18 min. Pomodoro.

* When I do a regular Pomodoro, it's usually for me a great way to beat my inner procrastinator and get started, which means that "just work for 20 min." usually becomes 45-60 min. of focused work, as I do not stop myself for my reward before I feel like it, here I have no choice but to do so or loose it.

However getting another fast paced workslot in during my day, is better than non, and when my punishment of 5 times is over, I've done 100 min. in total (20\*5 min.), that I otherwise would not have spend as productively :D
So put on your "yes-cap" and make the best of a bad situation and love it!

PS. Done with 1,5 min. left, time to edit that screenshot! XD
