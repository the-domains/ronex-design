important concepts that I work with, as it’s probably the most reliable predicting factor for when irrational behavior presents itself in an experience.
Also it’s the main concept that I work with in order to regulate habits. Because this is what makes you procrastinate.</p><p>Lets try this out: (I’m being mean here, please forgive me in advance, if you read to the end I will make it up to you though)</p><p>I now want you to think of the largest and most important project that you would like to work on (example: write a novel, read a book, do an analysis, clean the house, ect.), be it work, school, personal life, or whatever, it does not matter, just think of one….</p><p>Now try and think of all the tasks this project involves; like making a mental to-do list of everything it entails.</p><p>Now I want you to make a “cowboy prediction” of how long this will take you to get done.</p><p>Now answer me, do you feel like starting right now?</p><p>The answer is probably no, as I’ve deliberately tried to load a mountain of cognitive load on top of you, creating friction towards your goal; now it’s time to make it up to you :D</p><p>Start by taking 3 very deep breaths, focusing on relaxing and repeating the numbers of breaths you are at, counting down from 3 to 1, mentally whispering the numbers in your mind, creating a sensation of the numbers being distant, moving continuously away from you. (btw. this is a mindfullness hack called a “3-to-1 count”, which help you unload cognitive friction)</p><p>In order to understand why 3 simple reflections kills your desire to do what you really want to be doing, creating the need for breathing exercises, it would be heavily beneficial to do a quick “neurology 101” aka why your brain deceives you.</p><p>Our brain is actually kind of three brains in one, where it constantly shifts from one brain to the other as it’s dominating one, usually without that our consciousness perceives it.</p><p>in order to understand mental friction and procrastination, we need to understand the basics of two of the brains: the cerebral cortex and the limbic system.</p><p>If you are curious about the third, the brain stem, “google” it ;P</p><p>The cerebral cortex is the wonder of the modern human being, it’s the newest and most fancy addition to our wondrous human brain and what evolved us from cavemen to the state of intelligence humankind has today. The cerebral cortex is the main part of our prefrontal cortex, which governs things like complex problem-solving, abstract thinking, planning, and basically most of what you perceive as your personality and identity.
This is what pushes you to do something with your life and achieve the goals you are aiming for, as it’s this part of your brain that created those goals in the first place.</p><p>The limbic system is a bit more “primitive”, though way more dominant in our everyday lifes and much more complex in construction. This is the brain that governs emotional impulses (most relevant here; passion, love, fear and anxiety), memory and decision-making, while also being the link between the two other brains.</p><p>So when you started reading this the cerebral cortex was probably in charge, as this was a conscious decision to gain knowledge for whatever intrinsic motivating reason you are here to learn because of, or so I hope at least, it could also be that this post conveniently popped up as the limbic system had taken over, looking for “constructive procrastination opportunities” and here you are (which is my own reason for reading and watching a lot of weird stuff, making me somewhat of a brainiac on all matters not suited for pop-quizzes)
In either way, you should rejoice as I bring clarity with included solutions. (disclaimer: solutions requires work, get your magical quick fixes at the quack doctors office)</p><p>As I push you with these three simple reflections, I’m almost sure to trigger some sort of subconscious pain, which makes the limbic system take over, without you knowing it, the limbic system takes over in order to find a brief and effective relief of the mental stress created. </p><p>The breathing exercise is providing that relief to you without immediate procrastination, which makes you stop reading and starting to check up on push-notifications XD</p><p>The pain respons triggers the so called “fight or flight respons”, where one of the “flight-options” are procrastination, which for most of us are the default choice when faced with the fight or flight respons, as it’s the one that requires the least mental energy, to which there is minimal friction from one state of mind to another, unless we train our brain to subconsciously choose a solution like the 3-to-1 count.</p><p>Knowing this; understadning mental friction is easy, it’s basically the amount of mental energy you have to use in order to do a certain task. Some rules of thumb for this is:</p><ul><li>If you want to create good habits; minimize the amount initial energy requires to start on the task.</li></ul><ul><li> Example: If you want to learn to play the guitar and need to make it a habit practicing. Don’t keep the guitar in a guitarcase in the closet or under the bed, as your mom has taught you too, keep it close to where you spend your time; if you are a couch potato, keep it on a guitarstand next to the couch and watch the magic happen when you actually start picking it up and practise because it’s staring at you and it’s so easy to do!</li></ul><ul><li>If there’s a large amount of initial mental energy required to start a task, we will most likely find an alternative that requires less, which is when we start to be creative at finding alternatives aka procrastinating. The good news, if your great at procrastinating, is that it’s most likely because you're very creative and thereby great at creating alternatives ;)</li></ul><ul><li>If there’s little no non mental energy requires, the limbic system will see no reason to take over and you can easily hit the ground running.</li></ul><ul><li>If you want to stop a bad habit; maximize the amount of initial energy required to start the habit. </li></ul><ul><li>Example: I’m a gamer, always have been, and most likely will always be, in the sense that I really enjoy playing videogames. What I do to stop myself from spending too much time on video games? I keep my gaming mouse and mousepad in a designated “IT-bag” in my wardrobe at the top of my arms reach, away from my home office. Also the two mobile games I have on my phone is chosen for the short amount of time you are able to play in a row (only a few minutes) and are placed at the end of my pile of “other-apps” and notifications are turned off for them. Effectively creating so much friction it’s easier to listen to an audiobook on audible on my frontpage of apps, than starting a game. Works like a charm, effectively disrupted my default decision-making in order to be able to create new and better habits. Rewiring the limbic system.</li></ul><ul><li>Other classic examples:
If you have a tendency to come home mentally exhausted, trying to regain some energy by “pulling the mental plug” by watching some tv, only to sit there the rest of the night, resenting yourself for wasting too much time there? Pull the actual plug on the tv when you are done watching, don’t just put it on standby or flip a switch, get physical! (our inner procrastinator hates that!). Get someone you live with to hide the tv-remote before you get home (kids find this “hide & seek” game with the remote very fun, so if you have any, get them to do it).</li></ul><ul><li>If you want to run more (exercise in generel). Don’t put away your running shoes (just like the guitar example above), place them beside the front door and have an easily accessible place for your running cloth, near the shoes. Then the cherry on the cake, the big secret: don’t tell yourself to “get up from the couch and go for a run”, that’s too much initial mental energy, tell yourself to get up and get a glass of water or something similar easy and enjoyable (healthy, is important), when you are up from the cough, drinking water and reinforcing your mental image of being healthy, you automatically trigger a habitual series of events as following: “well…. It’s not really that much harder to just put on the running shoes to see if I feel like taking a short run”. Now standing in your running shoes, “I could easily take a 5 min. run”. Out running, “I can might as well push myself a little bit” and the 5 min. becomes 15-20 min. Now give yourself a pad on the back, take a moment to enjoy the rush of endorphins from the high puls activity and be present in the moment to really enjoy how good you feel about yourself.</li></ul><p>Now it will most likely make more sense to you why knowing something and acting upon it, is something entirely different, according to human behavior.</p><p>Knowing something and wanting to act on it, is a result of the cerebral cortex, which works mainly on a conscious level. Actual behavior, the “acting upon part”, is controlled by the limbic system, which is way stronger than the cerebral cortex, as it controls decision making, and as the limbic system mainly works on a subconscious level, willpower is rarely enough to make a chance.</p><p>This is why most doctors are slightly overweight, though they know better than anyone why to exercise and eat healthy and all that.
Why those researching sleep and knows the depths of it’s importance, rarely get enough, as they work by observing other people sleep, not by doing it themselves.</p><p>Which concludes the point I started this post about being an extremely reliable predicting factor for when we act irrational, like the above examples.</p><p>The above examples should also very well explain why this is such an important concept in regulating habits.</p><p>My work with gamification, is not only knowing this, but also to find ways to which this knowledge and be utilized and practically implemented in solutions, to help manage these cognitive biases.</p><p>To give an analogy:
Lets say you are a car.
And you have a desire to go from one country to another.</p><p>A psychotherapist or a coach, will try and help you adapt to the environment, effectively helping you to either sail or fly.
In most cases this is will a dramatic chance, redesigning you to become either a boat or an airplane. A few are succesful in a sort of hybrid, James Bond like solution, though for most this is wishful thinking.
And if you enjoy being a car and don’t want to be made into a boat or an airplane, that does not sound like an optimal solution to me.</p><p>I would much rather look at you and say “Ok. So you are a car, this is how a car works and this is it’s potential and it’s limitations”, then design a way for a car to cross from one country to another. </p><p>It might be a bridge, so an unlimited amount of other cars can enjoy the same solution, it can be car transport on a boat or even by airplane. Effectively designing the environment to adapt to the car and not the other way around, making it more enjoyable to be a car.</p><p>Now shift out the word car with human being and the challenge of going from one country to another, with a variety of other challenges, like handling finances, living healthy, being productive, being happy and you get the picture of what I do.</p><p>Bonus info:
The way I wrote this entire post, reading to the process above:
I’m taking a holiday, which means there’s no pressure or stress for me to perform and write whatsoever. (no fear of not performing, triggering the limbic system to make me procrastinate, letting me write in a state of mind controlled by the cerebral cortex, allowing for creative and constructive writing)
Then something triggered me to start thinking about this concept, to which I decided to write something in order to share my knowledge on this favorite subject of mine.
I did not decide to write the entire post right there, but I ended up doing it anyways.
I just started off like “in order to remember to write about it, let me just get started with some basic definitions and tag as few things to remember writing about, it’ll only take like 5 min.”
So I started writing, and as I was already started, I could just as well, give an example or two of this or that, like having a great casual conversation with a friends or intersting new person.
Suddenly I’ve emptied out my mind on paper for everyone to enjoy. (if you didn’t; that’s ok)</p><p>This mindset of “in intersting conversation” is a narrative I followed and now conclude and continue with: “Well now I’ve been talking for a while; do you have any questions, anything to add or?”</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="50"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="52"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="53"><span data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><h2 data-reactid="56"><a data-reactid="57">Ronex Design</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="60"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="61"></div></section></div></div>
